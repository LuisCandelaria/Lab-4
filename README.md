<p>
    For this laboratory you will have to add functionality to the basic calculator that is provided in the zip file under the laboratories description.
    <br>
    1) It is a basic calculator. You must add functionality to the buttons of RESET, =, +, -, *, /. Each button must attempt the operation that it’s selected. Every time that any button is clicked the input for numbers must be clean.
    <br>
    2) There is an input where you can type numbers. Those numbers are the ones that will be calculated with the operators described in step 1).
    <br>
    3) You must keep track of the result and display it on the RESULT = input when the user hits the = button.
    <br>
    4) The button of RESET will clean both your result and the input for numbers.
    <br>
    5) There is a text area at the bottom of the calculator. This text area is meant for keeping a log of all the operations done in the calculator.
